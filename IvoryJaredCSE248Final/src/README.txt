The purpose of a json object is to provide a uniform object structure. This simple text based object 
structure can be easily parsed and imported into whichever type of data object you want. (ex. Java Object or
Javascript object). The json object is small and receids in a .json file. These files are then grabbed from the
server than parsed into object and can be manipulated by a client. Then the object is turned back into .json file
and sent back to server.

A functional interface is an interface in which it has one method to be defined. This one method is then manipulated thereafter
in order to provide multiple functionality. By passing a predicate with a defined outcome lets say
	 ex. double compute(double arg1, double arg2) AND (x, y) -> x + y
you define the logic to which the interface uses.

The purpose of a rest api is to be a middle ground between a server and client application. The rest api provides a multitude of 
functions that allow for clients to access data. It is an application interface layer for a database.
